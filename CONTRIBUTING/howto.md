# Contributing
Contrubutng to LotBot is quite easy, we're open to any suggestions and contributions.

We do have a quality of code minimum you must meet to contribute. The floor for this will be outlined below.

## Python Version
LotBot is running on [Python 3.10.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/). It's expected of you
to develop with this version as well.

## Minimum Code Quality
It's expected of you to write code that is clean, well-commented, well-tested, well-documented,
and accurately typehinted. We do have a minimum code quality you must meet to contribute. Failure to do so will
result in your code being rejected.

## Have fun!
You need to remember, we're all here to learn and have fun. If you want to improve the quality of the code,
this is the place! If you want to implement a new feature, this is the place! If you want to contribute to the
codebase, this is the place!
